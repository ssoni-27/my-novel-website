            <h2>The Unbearable Silence</h2>
<p>The house was unnervingly quiet, the kind of silence that felt alive, wrapping itself around every corner. The mother’s day had been long but ordinary—lectures, assignments, the usual complaints from students about too much homework. She walked up to the gate of her modest home, balancing a heavy bag of books on one shoulder, her thoughts occupied with what to cook for dinner.
She opened the door, expecting the faint hum of her son’s music or the distant murmur of his voice on a call. Instead, an unnatural stillness greeted her. The living room was tidy, too tidy, as if frozen in time. A wave of unease began to creep up her spine.
<span class="dialogue">"“Beta?”"</span> she called out, her voice slicing through the silence. There was no response.
The faint glow of light under his bedroom door caught her attention. A small smile tugged at her lips, imagining him engrossed in another one of his projects. She set her bag down and walked toward the room, her heels clicking against the floor in the oppressive quiet.
She knocked lightly. “Beta, I’m home. Open the door,” she said, her tone soft but expectant. Still, no answer.
Her hand hesitated on the doorknob. “Are you listening? I’m coming in,” she called, pushing the door open. What met her eyes froze her in place.
The world seemed to tilt and blur as her gaze locked onto her son. He was hanging from the ceiling fan, his body limp, the faint creak of the fan the only sound in the room. His shadow danced grotesquely on the walls, a haunting reflection of a life cut short.
“No...” she whispered, the word barely audible, her breath hitching in her chest. Her knees buckled, and she stumbled forward, reaching out as if she could catch him, bring him back.
Her scream erupted, raw and piercing, shattering the silence. “No! Beta, wake up! Please!” She clutched his feet, her tears soaking the floor beneath her. Time seemed to stand still, every second dragging out like an eternity as she cried, begging for him to come back.
Her hands trembled as she reached for her phone, her mind a chaotic swirl of disbelief and agony. The phone slipped from her grip, clattering onto the floor, the sound echoing in the room like a final punctuation to her heartbreak. She collapsed again, clutching his lifeless legs, sobbing uncontrollably as memories flooded her mind. His first words, his laughter, his dreams, and his struggles—all of it, gone in an instant.
The scene dissolves into silence as the camera lingers on her shaking frame, the room heavy with grief and unanswered questions.

<h3>A Week Earlier</h3>

<p>Arjun sat on the edge of the newly paved highway, his back resting against a rusted signpost as the sounds of passing cars faded into the distance. Around him, the vast agricultural fields stretched endlessly under the dimming sky, an ocean of green and brown that seemed to mock the emptiness he felt inside. The cigarette between his fingers flickered in the soft evening light, its smoke curling up and disappearing into the cool air. He inhaled deeply, the bitter taste filling his lungs as the world around him blurred.
His thoughts were like a tidal wave, crashing one after the other, each memory more suffocating than the last. Betrayals—everywhere, from everyone who was supposed to care for him.
He closed his eyes, the images flashing behind his eyelids like a series of haunting snapshots. Her face—the girl he had once believed was the love of his life—was the first to appear. The memory of her naked with another man, those photos that he had never asked to see, but had stumbled upon in a cruel twist of fate. The shock was immediate, a burning betrayal that gutted him. He could still feel the sting of her absence, the way she had walked away from him without a second glance when the truth came out. She had replaced him, discarded him like an old, worn-out object when things got too real. Was I not enough? he thought bitterly, staring blankly at the ground.
His eyes burned, but he didn’t wipe away the tears. There was no point anymore.
The cigarette trembled in his hand as his father’s voice echoed in his mind. “You’ll never succeed in business. We’re not made for that kind of life,” he had said, with a cold certainty that crushed every ounce of hope Arjun had tried to hold onto. His father, a man of stability and routine, had never understood his dream. Every attempt to talk about his aspirations was met with rejection, with harsh words that tore apart his spirit. Every time Arjun reached for something different, his father’s disappointed gaze reminded him of his place—someone who should never stray from the beaten path. Arjun had tried to prove him wrong, but with every failed attempt at business, his father’s voice grew louder in his head. You’re wasting your time.
And then there were his friends—the ones who had once been his brothers, his closest allies. They had promised to stand by him, no matter what. But when the scam hit and he lost everything, they disappeared. They had convinced him to invest, to trust them, and when it all crumbled, they were nowhere to be found. You should’ve known better, they had said. Their voices—mocking, dismissive—echoed in his ears as they threw him under the bus without a second thought. The betrayal cut deeper than any loss of money—it was the loss of friendship, of trust, of people he had believed would never leave him behind. They were the ones who had given him empty promises, who had asked for his trust only to betray it when the going got tough.
The stinging rejection of his sister still burned, though it was more subtle. She had always been his confidant, the one he could turn to when the world felt too heavy. But now, she barely even acknowledged him. Every time he tried to talk, to share his struggles, she turned to others for advice. The distance between them grew wider with every passing day, like an unbridgeable chasm that only widened with time. He had once looked up to her, admired her strength, but now it felt like she preferred everyone else’s opinion over his. He was no longer her priority.
The cigarette had burned down to a stub, but Arjun barely noticed. His hand was numb, his body numb. His mind was a whirlwind of everything he had lost, everything that had been ripped away from him in the most painful ways. The world seemed far away, like he was a ghost wandering through it. He had nothing left. No one.
Tears mixed with the dirt on his face, and he didn’t even try to stop them. It wasn’t just the pain that had become unbearable—it was the hollow ache of knowing he had failed, of being discarded by everyone who had once meant something to him. No matter how hard he fought, no matter how much he tried, it was never enough. He was always too much of a disappointment, always too much of a burden. And now, he didn’t know where to go. The empty fields around him seemed to stretch out forever, just like the path he felt doomed to walk alone.
Arjun took another drag of the cigarette, but it tasted bitter. Every drag was a reminder of the things he couldn’t change, of the life he couldn’t fix. The world kept moving around him, but he was paralyzed by his own failures. He had nothing left to give. He had nothing left to hope for. His tears mingled with the smoke as he let out a shaky breath, the weight of everything crashing down around him, pulling him deeper into the darkness.











	



The Giver
Arjun sat on the rooftop, the night surrounding him like a heavy blanket. The cold air bit at his skin, but he barely felt it. His eyes were fixed on the starless sky, lost in the swirling thoughts that consumed him. He took a long drag of his cigarette, the smoke mingling with the chill, but it did nothing to ease the ache in his chest.
"How did it all fall apart?" he whispered, his voice barely audible over the silence of the night. "Was I that blind?"
He stared down at the ground below, feeling the distance grow between him and everything he once held dear. His friends—his brothers—had once meant the world to him. Manish, Rahul, Sandeep, Govind, Sangam, and Pradeep—he had given them everything. His trust. His time. His money. His loyalty. And now, they were gone.
"What happened to us? What happened to me?" Arjun’s voice cracked, a brokenness he hadn’t let himself feel until now seeping through. "I gave them everything. I gave them the best parts of me, and they—" His words caught in his throat, and he clenched his fist, the cigarette nearly falling from his hand.
The memories came crashing in like a violent wave.
Manish’s infectious laugh, the way he could turn even the dullest day into an adventure. Rahul, always pushing him to dream bigger, to aim higher. Sandeep, who could never cook but always found a way to make everyone feel at home with his clumsy charm. Govind, the quiet one, whose every word held weight, who used to stand by him no matter what. Sangam, always by his side, talking about the future like it was something they could conquer together. And Pradeep, whose loyalty once felt unshakable.
"I thought we were a family," Arjun whispered, his voice breaking. "I thought we’d always have each other’s backs."
But when everything crumbled, when the scam hit and his world shattered, they weren’t there. Not a single one of them. Not even a word of support. They vanished, leaving him to face the wreckage alone.
Arjun felt the burn of tears threatening to spill, but he held them back. His breath hitched as the pain surged inside him, sharp and raw. "They... they left me. After everything I did for them. After everything I gave. I was nothing to them. Just a tool to get ahead." He laughed bitterly, the sound hollow and void of joy. "I thought they cared. I thought I meant something to them."
His hands shook as he wiped away the tears that were no longer under his control. His mind spiraled, replaying every conversation, every promise they’d made. They’d told him they would always stand by him, that nothing could break their bond. But when the storm came, when things got tough, they had been the first to bail.
"You said you’d never leave. You said we were family," Arjun’s voice trembled with disbelief. "What was it all worth? All the jobs I got them. All the money I gave. What was it for?"
The pain in his chest was unbearable, and he gripped his shirt tightly as if that could somehow contain the storm inside him. "I was a fool. A damn fool," he muttered. "I gave them everything. And they just... walked away."
Arjun stood up, kicking the cigarette to the side, the ember glowing faintly in the darkness before it was extinguished by the wind. He wiped his eyes again, but the tears kept coming, his emotions finally breaking free after all this time.
"You know what hurts the most?" he whispered to the empty night, his voice breaking under the weight of his grief. "It's not just that they betrayed me. It’s that I thought... I thought I was enough for them. I thought my friendship, my loyalty meant something." He laughed bitterly again, as the tears flowed more freely now. "But no, I was just a convenience. And when the going got tough, they turned their backs."
He took a few shaky breaths, looking up at the night sky once more. "I thought I could fix it. I thought I could make it all better. But now… now I don’t even know who I am anymore. I don’t know what to do without them. I don’t know how to keep going."
Arjun sat back down, his legs pulling in, his face buried in his hands. He let the tears fall freely now, feeling the weight of everything that had been lost. "I just wanted to believe… that we were family," he whispered through his sobs. "But maybe... maybe I was wrong."
The sky above him seemed vast and indifferent, the stars hidden by the clouds, just like the hopes that had once felt so close, now forever out of reach.
He blinked. "Maybe that’s how I am," he murmured to no one in particular, his voice a soft rasp in the stillness. "A star passing by… unnoticed."
The words felt hollow, like an admission of defeat. But the shooting star, so brief yet so brilliant, sparked something deep within him—a bitter reminder of how easily things can fade. That was what he was now. Fading.
But as quickly as the star appeared, it was gone. Arjun sighed, wiping his eyes, trying to push away the growing tightness in his chest. He leaned back, pulling his knees close to his body, as memories from better days began to rush in. He thought of Manish—his closest friend, the one who had always been there, the one who had believed in him even when he had doubts.

            <p>He took a long drag, exhaling slowly. His mind drifted to the past, back to the laughter-filled nights with his friends, back when life felt simple.</p>

            <span class="dialogue">"If only things had been different,"</span> he murmured, his voice barely audible over the rustling leaves.

            <p>A smile tugged at the corner of his lips as he remembered their inside jokes. Yet, a tear found its way down his cheek, betraying the ache within.</p>

            <p>He leaned back, gazing at the stars. Somewhere in that vast expanse, did his friendships still exist? Or had they faded like smoke from his cigarette—visible for a moment, then lost forever?</p>
