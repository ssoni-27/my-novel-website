            <h2>The Unbearable Silence</h2>
<p>The house was unnervingly quiet, the kind of silence that felt alive, wrapping itself around every corner. The mother’s day had been long but ordinary—lectures, assignments, the usual complaints from students about too much homework. She walked up to the gate of her modest home, balancing a heavy bag of books on one shoulder, her thoughts occupied with what to cook for dinner.
She opened the door, expecting the faint hum of her son’s music or the distant murmur of his voice on a call. Instead, an unnatural stillness greeted her. The living room was tidy, too tidy, as if frozen in time. A wave of unease began to creep up her spine.
<span class="dialogue">"“Beta?”"</span> she called out, her voice slicing through the silence. There was no response.
The faint glow of light under his bedroom door caught her attention. A small smile tugged at her lips, imagining him engrossed in another one of his projects. She set her bag down and walked toward the room, her heels clicking against the floor in the oppressive quiet.
She knocked lightly. “Beta, I’m home. Open the door,” she said, her tone soft but expectant. Still, no answer.
Her hand hesitated on the doorknob. “Are you listening? I’m coming in,” she called, pushing the door open. What met her eyes froze her in place.
The world seemed to tilt and blur as her gaze locked onto her son. He was hanging from the ceiling fan, his body limp, the faint creak of the fan the only sound in the room. His shadow danced grotesquely on the walls, a haunting reflection of a life cut short.
“No...” she whispered, the word barely audible, her breath hitching in her chest. Her knees buckled, and she stumbled forward, reaching out as if she could catch him, bring him back.
Her scream erupted, raw and piercing, shattering the silence. “No! Beta, wake up! Please!” She clutched his feet, her tears soaking the floor beneath her. Time seemed to stand still, every second dragging out like an eternity as she cried, begging for him to come back.
Her hands trembled as she reached for her phone, her mind a chaotic swirl of disbelief and agony. The phone slipped from her grip, clattering onto the floor, the sound echoing in the room like a final punctuation to her heartbreak. She collapsed again, clutching his lifeless legs, sobbing uncontrollably as memories flooded her mind. His first words, his laughter, his dreams, and his struggles—all of it, gone in an instant.
The scene dissolves into silence as the camera lingers on her shaking frame, the room heavy with grief and unanswered questions. </p>
